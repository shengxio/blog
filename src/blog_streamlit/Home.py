        I am a versatile Data Scientist and Solutions Architect with extensive experience in both software development and industrial automation. My expertise spans across multiple domains, from developing AI-powered applications to implementing industrial control systems.

        In the realm of AI and Machine Learning, I specialize in:
        - Developing and deploying machine learning models for predictive analytics and natural language processing
        - Creating intelligent systems using large language models for content analysis and automation
        - Building scalable data pipelines and APIs using modern frameworks like FastAPI and Flask
        - Implementing cloud-native solutions across AWS, Azure, and GCP platforms

        My industrial automation background includes:
        - Designing and implementing PLC-based control systems
        - Developing temperature prediction and monitoring systems for cold chain logistics
        - Creating autonomous environmental control systems for industrial applications
        - Implementing electrical systems for various industrial applications

        I bring a unique combination of skills that bridge the gap between traditional industrial systems and modern AI solutions. My projects demonstrate this versatility - from developing AI-powered co-pilot systems for transportation to implementing autonomous bioreactor control systems.

        My technical expertise includes:
        - Programming: Advanced proficiency in Python, with strong capabilities in web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
        - Libraries & Frameworks: Extensive experience with data science tools (pandas, Scikit-learn) and web frameworks (FastAPI, Flask, Streamlit)
        - Cloud Platforms: Comprehensive knowledge of cloud services across AWS, Azure, and GCP
        - Industrial Systems: Deep understanding of PLC programming and industrial automation

        I am passionate about creating solutions that combine cutting-edge AI technologies with practical industrial applications. Whether it's developing intelligent agents for process automation or implementing smart control systems, I focus on delivering robust, scalable, and efficient solutions.
